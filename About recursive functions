Recursive Functions
  1. basic features
    (1) It contains a recursive procedure and a backtracing procedure.
    (2)It decreases the complexity of the code, though increasing the time complexity with loads of unnecessary repeated calculating when the times of the recursion get higher.
    (3)The trust of recursion 
  2. algorithm based on recursive functions
